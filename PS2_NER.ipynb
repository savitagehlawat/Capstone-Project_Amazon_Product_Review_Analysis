It is low on fat and carbs while still giving a high dose of protein.I usually mix with milk (as I don't currently have a blender) and it mixes pretty well but sometimes still get a few chunks. It has also taken me a while to get used to since I have never eaten protein shakes before, which also means I can't compare it to other products. The flavor overall is fairly good and it is reminiscent of cake mix. It tastes a lot better when I make it in a smoothie with added fruit, ice, and other mix-ins; most likely because it hid the flavor better (I use The Abs Diet recipes).I found it is a great snack for me between meals or for breakfast or after workouts.

        "       \"B0010O748Q\":\"I purchased this product the Magnesium Fire Starter Product and the Light My Fire Swedish Fire Steel 2.0 Army. I will give you my experience testing both products.Magnesium Fire Starter:I had problems with this product initially, because there is a very thick protective coating covering the flint rod. It took a little effort to scrape off the coating. You will not get any sparks until this coating is completely removed. Using the included striker/saw, I was able to produce a reasonable amount of sparks. Surprisingly, I was able to generate a greater volume of sparks using the striker included with the Light My Fire Swedish Fire Steel 2.0. The Magnesium Fire Starter requires a little preparation and practice to be reliable.Light My Fire Swedish Fire Steel 2.0 Army:The Swedish Fire Steel is ready to go right out of the package. It generates a shower of hot potent sparks with little effort. If you need to get a fire started in a hurry this is the better choice when good tender is available. It cost a little more, but it creates a much hotter shower of sparks and makes quick work of starting a fire.Test Conditions:My test consisted of starting a fire from material available on a beach in Florida. I gathered relatively dry tender that had fallen from palm trees. The tender was a little thicker then I would prefer, but that is what was available at the time. I tried both products and neither would create a fire from the thick tender with sparks alone. Then I created a few magnesium shavings on the palm tender with the Magnesium Fire Starter Product . The spark from the Magnesium Fire Starter Product was hot enough to ignite the magnesium shavings, but did not ignite the palm tender. The hotter spark from the Light My Fire Swedish Fire Steel ignited the magnesium shavings and ignited the palm tender resulting in combustion very quickly.Conclusion:I prefer the Light My Fire Swedish Fire Steel 2.0 Army for most applications - 99% of the time. If you need to start a fire with damp tender, the Magnesium Fire Starter Product will be a handy addition to the party. Being able to create magnesium shavings with the saw is a handy feature in extreme situations\",\n",

The ER-GN30-K is a vast improvement, especially with the dual-edge blade that cuts nasal and facial hairs that now enter the trimmer not only the sides but also the top. As the literature indicates, it is perfect for trimming individual stray hairs on the eyebrows or facial hair. The new Vortex Cleaning System is easy to use by running the trimmer in water it thoroughly cleans the trimmer head. The trimmer is lighter than the E411 with a new ergonomic design, curved, hypo-allergenic stainless steel blades, plus wet-dry operation. It takes AA batteries (NOT INCLUDED?)

        "       \"B001F51VRK\":\"I have been given the opportunity to try Secret's new clinical strength deodorants Product over the past few months, products which I would not have paid the additional funds to try out. I have been very pleased with all of them, including the marathon fresh or sport version. All of the clinical strength advanced deodorants have an unusual consistency, not like their other products I have always used. However, one of the things I really like about them is the fact they do not ball up or leave streaks in my shirts. They seem to absorb well and the protection really seems to hold up all the way around.Many times I believe manufacturer's create new and improved products which really are not much different than their predecessors and use it to inflate their prices. However, this is one of the few times I believe that is not entirely the case. Yes, I think the clinical strenth line is over-priced but it is definitely a vast improvement over previous types of Secret deodorants Product I have used over the years.\"  \n",

The protein powder that he wanted me to buy at the gym was way too pricey for my budget (Xsport brand).  So I bought this as an alternative because it had a similar composition.  It is low on fat and carbs while still giving a high dose of protein.I usually mix with milk (as I don't currently have a blender) and it mixes pretty well but sometimes still get a few chunks.  It has also taken me a while to get used to since I have never eaten protein shakes before, which also means I can't compare it to other products.  The flavor overall is fairly good and it is reminiscent of cake mix.  It tastes a lot better when I make it in a smoothie with added fruit, ice, and other mix-ins; most likely because it hid the flavor better (I use The Abs Diet recipes).I found it is a great snack for me between meals or for breakfast or after workouts.  It keeps me full but it does leave me feel sort of bloated after drinking one.Buying it in a larger quantity means getting a better deal.  So it's a good deal for what I think is a little higher quality protein powder.\",\n",
